# 15-112-Project

My final project will be a “fake OS” (inspired by an upperclassmen). It isn’t really an OS in the sense that it can’t organize the use of memory or control storage, hence emphasis on the word “fake”. 

### Description:
A fake OS where you can create an account and log in. There will be essential programs like a calculator, paint and notepad and a game or two. You can also save files from these programs (e.g. save a file of what you wrote on notepad, it’ll show up on your fake OS’s desktop and save it to your actual computer in a directory for later access when you log back in). There will be specific voice commands to carry out certain actions like opening different applications.

### Libraries/APIs Used:
- Tkinter - used to create the UI.
- Google’s speech recognition - used to detect voice commands to operate certain applications.
- (Possibly) Pygame - to create the games and embed it.

### User Interface:
It will be created with Tkinter, there will be a screen where the user can choose their name from the registered users and login or create an account. In the main screen after logging in, there will be a task bar at the bottom with a start button that opens a start menu where you could access the different applications as well as sign out or shutdown, it will also have a button where you could operate using voice commands. Applications will run in the form of windows where you can minimize or close them completely.

### Initial Features (first checkpoint):
- A user registration and login system where each person can have their own account on the program.
- Initial programs which include: notepad, paint, calculator.
- The ability to save files under the logged in user and access them later when you log back in (i.e. save your drawings on paint, save text on notepad).

### Final Features (complete features):
All the features listed above as well as:
- Add a game or two to the project and have the ability to save the scores of the user.
- Speech regonition to open the apps and do certain commands.
- Better and cleaner UI with images in place of empty buttons (e.g. shutdown button) which in turn, improves the UX.

### Special Features
- Saving files to the user’s computer and parsing it later to be able to retrieve the data (e.g. on paint).
- Nice UI. (hopefully)
